========================

**django CMS Inline Comment** is a plugin for `django CMS <http://django-cms.org>`_ that allows you to add comments to the structure board, visible to editors only. You can nest other plugins inside an inline comment, which renders them invisible on a published page.

(If you need a CMS plugin for public-facing comments, please have a look at https://github.com/Nekmo/djangocms-comments, https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-disqus, or https://github.com/mishbahr/djangocms-fbcomments.)
